      <li>Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined.</li>
      <li> Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top.</li>
      <li> Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached.</li>
      <li>Combine the milk, butter, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a rolling boil (stirring occasionally) and cook for 30 to 45 seconds, then remove from the heat. </li>
